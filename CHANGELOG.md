## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Introduced a set of utilities for working with generate Julia code (Eg, extract code-fenced Julia code with `PromptingTools.extract_code_blocks` ) or simply apply `AICode` to the AI messages. `AICode` tries to extract, parse and eval Julia code, if it fails both stdout and errors are captured. It is useful for generating Julia code and, in the future, creating self-healing code agents 

### Fixed
- Changed type of global `PROMPT_SCHEMA::AbstractPromptSchema` for an easier switch to local models as a default option

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- Add support for prompt templates with `AITemplate` struct. Search for suitable templates with `aitemplates("query string")` and then simply use them with `aigenerate(AITemplate(:TemplateABC); variableX = "some value") -> AIMessage` or use a dispatch on the template name as a `Symbol`, eg, `aigenerate(:TemplateABC; variableX = "some value") -> AIMessage`. Templates are saved as JSON files in the folder `templates/`. If you add new templates, you can reload them with `load_templates!()` (notice the exclamation mark to override the existing `TEMPLATE_STORE`).
- Add `aiextract` function to extract structured information from text quickly and easily. See `?aiextract` for more information.
- Add `aiscan` for image scanning (ie, image comprehension tasks). You can transcribe screenshots or reason over images as if they were text. Images can be provided either as a local file (`image_path`) or as an url (`image_url`). See `?aiscan` for more information.
- Add support for [Ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai/)'s local models. Only `aigenerate` and `aiembed` functions are supported at the moment.
- Add a few non-coding templates, eg, verbatim analysis (see `aitemplates("survey")`) and meeting summarization (see `aitemplates("meeting")`), and supporting utilities (non-exported): `split_by_length` and `replace_words` to make it easy to work with smaller open source models.
